                    I've been working in aviation industry since 2000.
                    Initially I worked as a first officer "An-2", after that I've been piloting “Let 410”.
                    I finished my flying career in 2019.
                    Since 2017 I've been working as a Chief of Aeronavigation Information Office providing aeronavigational information.
                    I want to change my profession and look for new opportunities for self-development.
